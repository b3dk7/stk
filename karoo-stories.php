  <h2 itemprop="headline" id="moos">Mr Moos's story</h2>
  <span itemprop="text">

<p>One cold and grey winter afternoon Mr Moos arrived on our farm with his meager possessions and his family piled on his donkey cart.   A large man with a black beard, looking for a place to outspan his animals, and stay overnight.    He had his wife, Meraai and two sons with him. A small compact family.</p><p>
 
It so happened that at that time a set of extra hands were needed on the family farm. Soon an agreement was agreed upon and Mr Moos and his family moved into one of the workers' homes and settled down.  From then on this little  family became an integral part of all farm activities.</p><p>
  
 It was 1992.   Moos was a sturdy and stalwart young man, a reliable and trustworthy worker,  a leader and someone who was prepared to roll up his sleeves  without ever shying away from hard work or responsibility. A man who truly did his share, a man who lived and let live.</p><p>
 
The years went by and Mr Moos grew older, but he remained the reliable and trusted member of the team, always setting an example.</p><p>
 
In June 2011, his beloved eldest son suddenly died of natural causes. Shortly afterwards, his younger son was murdered.  . A part of Mr Moos died too. His reason for existing was taken away from him and the deep traces of  loss  left it's mark on him.   Traces of sorrow and pain were etched deeply around his mouth and eyes.   Then, a broken man, unable to battle on after these fateful blows, he decided to retire. The trusted man was given the rights to remain and live in his house on the farm for the rest of his days.  This was the most we could do to help him live out the rest of his life in peace.</p><p>
 
The  Moos with whom one talks today is in some ways still the "old"  Moos, the person everybody is fond of and looks up to.  But he is  worn and tired. stooped and grey.  His eyes are dim  and without the old sparkle.  </p><p>
 
One day he came,  with great difficulty, to ease himself down beside me where I sat on a big stone in the veld.  His eyes were rheumy and sad as he stared into the distance, and his thin lips tightly drawn. I thought  that something particular must be disturbing him.   His forehead was creased more than usual with frowning.   It had to be something important, something serious, because he had never been a man to complain or object about anything, or feel sorry for himself.</p><p>
 
He sighed a few times and managed to speak up with a bitterness and a disappointment which I had not encountered from him before. "I hear", he said, "they will take our farm.  Strange things  made of tin will stand in our yard. What for?" He sighs. "I have to go too. All of us. What  will happen to us now?   Here is where I want to lay my head down when I take my last breath. Here is where my blood and my sweat lies. You were good to me, and we looked after each other.  We worked  together and we shared our happiness and our pain" His eyes filled with tears.  'But what is to happen to us now?"</p><p>
 
 I do not have an answer for Moos.   I share his pain, I feel it deep down, and together we were overcome by raw emotion. The pain lingers everywhere, it will not go away, it swells and sways with the endless motion of the wind in the branches of the old weeping willow tree.</p>

  <span itemprop="text"><p>There is a "family stone" on the farm Swartfontein covered with signatures of family members who have been living and farming there for five generations. 
  </p><p>Stone masons James Wright and Cornelis de Waal were the artists responsible for these unique sandstone gravestones which are over a hundred years old, and are still in good condition. These gravestones are also to be seen on other farms in the district. It took Cornelis de Waal from 4 to 5 months to complete the inscriptions, flower patterns and decorations. He was paid from 5 to 7 pounds sterling to execute this work.</p>
  <p>Williston has a "Gravestone Route" which encompasses the "Old Amandelboom, The VKG- and the old NG church graveyard, as well as Koega, Oest and Dassiekloof, where the work of these stone masons are to be seen. </p>
  <p>Dr. Celestine Pretorius has written a book titled "The history of Folk Art in South Africa" which includes a chapter concerning graveyard art. 
  </p><p>The Beehive Houses (korbeelhuise) occur mainly in the Williston district. A unique example of these has been erected at the Carnarvon Museum. 
  </p><p>Bushman art on rock faces are to be found in this area. These works of art lend a unique value to the farms on which they are to be seen. 
  </p><p>Mr. de Wet Net, a retired lawyer from Carnarvon, has completed his first book titled "Karoo Kaleidoscope, a Historic Perspective". He has taken a keen interest in the fate of the San people, as well as other indigenous groups. In his book he describes the history and the origin of these people, as also the arrival of other groups into this area. 
  </p><p>We remember the determination and hard work which our forefathers displayed in developing this area, giving us the opportunity to carry on with their work and carve out for ourselves a good and productive life. </p></span>

  <h2 itemprop="headline">Nommer Asseblief</h2>
  <span id="authinfo">Written by <span itemprop="author">Mr. L</span>, <span itemprop="datePublished">2016-1</span></span>
  <span itemprop="text"><p>I grew up with the old "nommer asseblief' telephone system. The old bakelite telephone, with a crank handle on the side, was mounted on a wooden board and put on the wall. You and your neighbors shared the same line, and you had to be careful not to turn the handle if someone was already busy on the line. By today's standards primitive, but effective and satisfactory. The operators, and the technicians, were efficient and all was kept in good order.</p>
  <p>Those were the good old days. With the passage of time the system gradually deteriorated. Cables were either stolen or broke down. We were sometimes left for days without any contact with the outside world.</p>
  <p>During 2007 plans for SKA were made public. A meeting was held at Klerefontein (farm in Carnarvon district) attended by all affected parties. The project was explained and it was promised that the farmers in the area surrounding the SKA project would receive a specific telephone system, namely a type of radio telephone. 
  </p><p>Well, this never materialized. In Nov. 2011 certain farmers were provided with a Vodacom dish and they were able to receive cell phone reception. This was a ray of light and gave farmers a feeling of security. Security by this time was becoming a worry as, with the development of SKA there were now more vehicles on the roads and more strangers in the area. 
  </p><p>All went well until May 2012. The cell phone signals were said to be interfering with <a href="http://public.ska.ac.za/kat-7">KAT-7</a> and they were summarily cut off. 
  </p><p>Radio telephones were still not available. We were now left to our own devices. At the end of 2013 Telkom stepped in and the Spacestream telephone system was installed. Fortunately for the last year and a half we have been free of trouble. 
  </p><p>In a nutshell, SKA never kept to their promise of 2007 to provide farmers with radio telephones. We are grateful to Telkom for their assistance. 
  </p><p>In "injury time" when SKA'S new program was made available to the public, the <a href="http://www.yahclick.co.za/ was introduced">VOX system</a>. This was during 2015 - eight years after the original promise was made.</p></span>

  <h2 itemprop="headline">A valuable contribution to the national food basket</h2>
  <span id="authinfo">Written by <span itemprop="author">Mrs. M</span>, <span itemprop="datePublished">2016-1</span></span>
  <span itemprop="text">
    <p>About seven years ago, before SKA was well known, I was listening to "RSG", a South African radio program whilst doing my daily chores. The person on the program explained things about the chosen SKA site, and mentioned the farms, Losberg and Meysdam. The area, she explained, was a very quiet site and also surrounded by mountains, and therefore a well chosen position for the SKA project.</p> 

    <p>She then justified the chosen site by adding that it was a place "beyond civilisation". This really upset and shocked me. I was furious, the audacity of belittling our area and our people like that! Why insult the inhabitants of the Kareeberg area? So many intellectuals and academics have emerged from the area, and well educated and informed people reside and lead great lives here. Our people are civilised, harmonise with each other, and are kind and goodhearted.</p>

    <p>Consider the high standard of agricultural activities and the quality stock we produce despite harsh and challenging circumstances. How can an uncivilised area provide a much desired product of superior quality, which "civilised" people crave elsewhere. What about our contribution to the national food basket?</p>

    <p>Apparently the person who spoke out of turn on the radio program, had wanted to imply that the area is isolated when she called it "beyond civilisation. What ever... the incident angered me and it has stayed with me to this day.</p>
