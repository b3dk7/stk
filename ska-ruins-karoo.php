	    <h2>Some Background Information</h2>

	    <p>Many South Africans have been keen and excited about the radio astronomy, Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project. Marketing strategies and the <a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/">SKA website</a> present a convincing and impressive picture of SKA South Africa. There is no need to argue the scientific merits of the project.</p>
	    <p>The "other side" of the project is less convincing. It is the Ecocide which will affect communities and the environment due to SKA phase 1. Construction of phase 1 is planned to start in 2018. Later, SKA phases 2 and 3 are planned to follow, finally reaching far into the African Continent. According to the Radio Quiet Zone Document, page 10, remote stations are proposed to be placed in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. The RQZ document goes on to state that these African countries have "basic law", implying  that enforcing a radio quiet zone would be possible</p>
	    <p>The current SKA site in the Karoo consists of two farms (Losberg and Meysdam) and covers 13,406 ha. Here
 pathfinder and precursor radio telescope dishes have been erected. The Kat-7 project, a test bed of seven dishes, was completed several years ago. The MeerKAT project of 64 dishes, a technology demonstrator for South Africa's bid to host the Square Kilometer Array is still under construction and will form part of SKA phase 1.</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/kat7.jpg" alt="Kat7">
	
 
        <p> South Africa and Australia jointly won the bid in 2012 and are the official hosts, but South Africa will host the majority share. The South African SKA foundation is currently negotiating to buy more land (about 118 000 ha / or + - 36 farms) around the initial site, to create a larger core area of about 130 000 ha.</p>
        <p>SKA phase 1 does not only consist of the above mentioned core area, but also includes three long arm-like spiraling corridors. Along these corridors additional satellite dishes are to be constructed. These corridors are planned to run over "active farms". Servitude on roads, power lines and pockets of land are planned. Restrictions will protect radio astronomy and affect farming activities for up to 11 km on either side of each of the satellite dishes, making corridors of 22 km in width. These restrictions reduce or prohibit the generation of power, wind energy, electric fencing, spark plugs (petrol driven vehicles included),flying an aeroplane, constructing roads and houses, broadcasting a radio signals, operating microwaves, welding and the use of certain machines. Only radio frequencies below 100 Mhz, and above 25.5 Ghz will be tolerated, and not regulated.</p>
        <p>A person who contravenes the restrictions will face a fine of up to R 1 000 000 (one million rand) or imprisonment, or both according to a warning issued by Government Gazette. Within South Africa one million Rand would represent an amount which an average person would have work hard to accumulate within a life time of earning. Currently an ordinary loaf of bread in South Africa cost from under R10 and may go up up to R15 depending on the type of bread, a litre of petrol sells for approximately R 13, while aviation fuel (Avgas) sells at just over R20 a litre.</p>
        <p>The above mentioned core area and corridors are situated in a semi-desert called the Karoo. The Karoo makes up most of the Northern Cape Province and this province covers 30 % of South Africa's total land surface. Here sheep farming upholds the economy. Agricultural land is therefore under discussion and the stability of 3 municipalities with 46 000 inhabitants is questioned. "Karoo, Meat of Origin", a well-known organic lamb label with impressive export credentials, is proudly produced in the area. Arguably it is of the best meat in the world.</p>
        <p>In a document published in 2005, <a href=http://46.101.110.164/26437_73_RITaskForce.pdf>"SKA Task Force on Regulatory Issues, November 2005"</a>  International experts recommend the implementation of the SKA project. On page 7 is stated "...a  radio-quiet  zone  (RQZ) is  necessary..." and on page 8, "Typical sectors that may be affected would be communications (both regulation  and communications infrastructure),land affairs, environmental  affairs, civil aviation  and  mineral  affairs. There  may be further impact at the state or provincial level in terms of roads, distribution networks of electrical power and other public services." These experts do not mention human rights, ecocide or the social and economic impacts.</p>
	    <p>SKA phase 1 will be largely funded by the SKA International Partner States. These financial contributors are  the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Italy, The Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, India and China. The SKA Organisation is a private company incorporated and has its head office in the United Kingdom. In addition there are several non-member States which benefit by receiving research data, such as Universities and the Max Planck Institution in Germany. The USA has part of its HERA project on the South African SKA core site. Further non-member states include France, Japan, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. www.skatelescope.org</p>

	    <h2 id="Impacts,-Aviation,-Communication">Impacts, Aviation and Communication</h2>
        
        <h3>Aviation</h3>

        <p>Radio frequency restrictions and aviation laws are obviously contradictory concepts. Almost all flight to and from Cape Town have always flown over the Northern Cape as Cape Town is geographically at the southern tip of Africa. Therefore the Karoo was never a radio quiet area. Obviously the availability of radio frequencies are paramount to aviation safety with regard to radar, navigation and radio communications. These rights were stipulated in the Chicago Convention of 1944 and most nations are signatory to this agreement. Should many or all flights to and from Cape Town be re-routed to protect astronomy within the Karoo? How much will this cost travellers? How would this affect the carbon footprint of air travel? Carnarvon was never radio quiet...   http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/first-radio-licence-sa-issued-dr-j-van-rensburg-carnarvon<p> 

        <h3>Communication</h3>

        <p>The AGA Act no 21 of 2007, was drafted to allow for an Astronomically Advantaged Area (AAA) where legislation prohibits the frequencies allowing cellphone signals. Admittedly cellphone communication vastly improved since 2007. By 2015 when SKA phase 1 was presented to the public, mobile technology had already changed the world. Smartphones are a way of life today. It is unthinkable to sacrifice the freedoms, safety, business opportunities and access to information afforded by mobile hand-held devices. Should cellphone signals be cut off due to legislation people affected by SKA phase 1 will be left with weather-sensitive satellite land-line connections and wifi within their homes. A "souped-up" walkie-talkie with a vastly limited sms function and without internet connection has been offered to stakeholders by SKA, but nobody is excited about this option. Cellphones remain the chosen and only means of communication for most in the affected area.</p>
  
        <h2 id="CSIR">CSIR</h2>

	    <p>The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) commissioned several experts to perform a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) within the area affected by SKA phase 1. Research was collected on economic, social, environmental and heritage and cultural issues. This study ran throughout most of 2016, and a report is apparently due early in 2017. Once the report is approved the legislation could be passed.</P>

        <p>CSIR stated it would honour a commitment of total transparency and share experts finding, reports and information with stakeholders. Sadly this information has not reached stakeholders to date. Save The Karoo asks the CSIR to please share all such documents with stakeholders as soon as possible. The information could also be shared on this website so it may be available for all affected and interested parties.</p>

        <p>The CSIR website stated in November 2016 that its board members were appointed by the Minister of the Department of Science and Technology from 2015 through 2018. These dates co-inside with the initial announcement of the land acquisition for SKA phase 1 and the intended start of construction for SKA phase 1. This has raised questions about a possible conflict of interests.</p>

 <p>In the absence of original Expert reports, Save The Karoo has compiled some of the more obvious impacts for  consideration. Save The Karoo will upload these reports as soon as the CSIR make them available.</p>

	     <h2 id="economic-impact">Economic Impact</h2>

	   	 <p>About 15 000 lambs and 7000 adult sheep are annually marketed on the farms SKA would like to buy for the core area of phase 1. Should these farms stop producing an annual loss of 20 to 30 million may result and certainly impact hard on the local communities. Abattoirs will be immediately affected and the profitability of these companies may not be sustained, as they would drop about 10% in slaughter volumes. One may consider that a minimum monthly wage of R 3 500, to be implemented over a two year period, was debated in South Africa during 2016, and this puts the loss of 20 to 30 million into perspective. Lamb and mutton is not the only source of income in this area. Stud farming, wool and feedlots also generate capital.</p>

         <p> Farm workers will not find new employment easily as unemployment figures are around 32 % in the area. Alternative job opportunities are not being created. There are no government incentive programs to attract new business opportunities to the area.</p> 

	     <p>Abattoirs, fuel suppliers, agricultural co-operatives, hardware stores, supermarkets, banks, tradesmen, construction and engineering services will all lose customers. Suppliers of veterinarian products, solar power and pumps, irrigation and water systems, fencing and general farm equipment will drop sales. Remote monitoring equipment used to track stock, read water levels, ensure safety of people and animals and prevent stock theft will suffer a decline in sales. Meat agents, marketing-, transport- and packing companies, retailers, the hospitality industry and finally ordinary consumers will be affected nationally. Reduction in turnover affect sales in commodities, insurances, recreation, travel and assets investment. Fewer transactions result in a decline of sales tax each time money changes hands, and reduced income taxes. These "add-ons" annually result in hundreds of millions of rand. It is highly unlikely that any scientific project could replace such amounts to the growing economy of South Africa.</p>

         <p>Towns and businesses might decline and shrink. Displacement of people may result. More and more employees may land on the street if a downward trend is started. Typically, financially weaker members of society might be disadvantaged the most. Local families who lost ownership of property under the previous regime have not recovered losses or enjoyed compensation to date. Now these communities face more disadvantages. The town called Van Wyksvlei suffered a blow when a weaponry testing site called Alkantpan bought out farms (85 000 ha) in the district in 1987. The town was greatly reduced and impoverished. This is an explicit example of what Karoo communities are exposed to once farms are forced out of production. The inhabitants in the Karoo are completely reliant on agriculture for their well being and survival. Alkantpan and SKA ground are very close together and this area cannot take another punch to its economy. Alkantpan brought Van Wyksvlei to its knees, how much more can it take? At Alkantpan, foreign clients benefit  while locals suffer. http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=45559:sixty-percent-plus-of-alkantpans-inco</p> 

         <p>Laws within South Africa demand Capital gains taxes on property. Therefore once landowners are forced to sell ground they cannot replace land of a similar quality. These losses are not taken into account or compensated for by the land buy-out scheme benefiting the SKA project. Individuals suffer real losses.</p>

	     <p>Estimates as to how farming activities along the intended spiralling corridors will be economically affected due to the regulations and restrictions are tricky to calculate. Land management and preservation without the use of machines and equipment might be impossible in the long run, and cause environmental damage. The inconveniences caused by the regulations and the absence of technological development associated with radio frequencies could in time deter younger generations all together. The remote monitoring equipment allowing modern and convenient farming practises will most likely be prohibited, and pose safety threats. This will cause a substantial loss in income for these farms and all the dependants. Farms could be reduced to stock posts in due course. Stock posts are typically less productive, contribute to falling populations figures and reduced incomes. The migration patterns from rural to urban areas stress many big cities in South Africa already. Here unemployment, lack of accommodation, poor living conditions, increased crime, transport, health, sanitation and hygiene are mayor expenses to the national economy. Functioning agricultural and rural communities alleviate problems in cities and improve the population distribution of a nation. Agricultural communities feed those who live in cities.</p>

	     <h3>Food security</h3>

	     <p>Economics, productivity, human resources and food security cannot be separated. Food security has been an issue in Southern Africa, especially after recent droughts. Currently 25 percent of South Africa's sheep are found in the Northern Cape, according to National livestock Statistics. Therefore this area contributes substantially to the national food basket and national revenue, despite a relatively low population. Statistic have shown that the Northern Cape Province is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_African_provinces_by_gross_domestic_product_per_capita>third highest per capita income tax</a> contributors among South African provinces. It is therefore not fair to refer to the Karoo as a low-income, uninhabited and impoverished area. Sadly there are many poorer areas in South Africa.</p>

	     <h3>Wool, Game and Tourism</h3>

	     <p>The Northern Cape is the fourth largest wool supplier in the country, and the industry is growing due to better wool prices and a weak Rand. Northern Cape wool producers do well nationally, and can boast a number of well-respected breeders. The game industry is growing steadily, with surprisingly high prices making news at annual animal auctions. The game and tourist industries are closely linked. The Karoo is a sought after by nature lovers seeking tranquillity, unspoiled open space and simply "getting away from it all". But, much more can be done to promote the Karoo as a "Great Escape" tourist destination. There are some very beautiful farms with corbelled houses, rock art, scenic walks and with great hospitality and kind people in the area. Good accommodation and fine eateries with exceptional lamb on the menu makes it a fine place to visit and experience something completely different.</p>

	     <h3>SKA makes economic contributions to a local town</h3>

	     <p>SKA has donated computers for educational purpose in Carnarvon. Five students received bursaries for further studies, and SKA employed a member of staff at the Carnarvon school. Locals are employed to develop SKA infrastructure, but this will only last during construction. SKA officials have proposed employing farm workers to eradicating invasive trees in the area. However, farm workers are very specialised in what they do and might not want to chop down trees for a living. SKA must please inform Save The Karoo about the benefits Williston, Van Wyksvlei and Brandvlei have received so these benefits donated by SKA may be included on this site. These handouts might instil a situation where dependency and expectations grow rather than allowing a robust self-sufficient and independent community to flourish according to to it own productivity. Handouts and grants in South Africa have aided those in dire need but have also spoilt and ruined initiative and ambition. SKA's intentions and policies with regard to donations has not been clearly communicated, and the sustainability and way forward is also unclear.</p>

         <h2 id="environmental-impact">Environmental impact</h2>

	     <h3>The Karoo</h3>

	     <p>The Karoo has a unique landscape and a sensitive ecosystem. Dry phases are common in the Karoo, but the area is quite drought resistant, meaning that the vegetation has relatively good nutritional value even during drought periods. The central Karoo has average annual rainfall of about 230 to 250 mm. After the rains it turns green very rapidly, providing excellent grazing and substantial ground cover. Hardy indigenous plants and animal species of enormous diversity have developed over millions of years and adapted to heat, cold, droughts and floods. Typically, erosion can occur after the thunderstorms, and it is important to retain top soil and not disturb the natural vegetation or surface areas. Large scale construction activities will remove and damage  vegetation and top soil, potentially creating opportunities for soil erosion which may in time spread over vast areas, and finally desertification could be a threat. Rehabilitation of hardy vegetation requires diligent effort over an extended period of time, as it is a semi-desert. The <a href=http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-the-magical-great-karoo>Karoo is not a desert.</a>   </p>

         <h3>Wild Animals need drinking facilities</h3> 

	     <p>Wild animals in the Karoo have adapted to farming conditions and live in synchronicity with stock and farming activities. It is no longer possible for wild animals to migrate according to water availability as they did in former times before fences were introduced to the area. The wild animals use the drinking facilities which have been built for stock. Many animal species are protected and endangered in the Karoo. Particular attention must be given to the riverine rabbit, birds of prey, in particular the Verreaux eagle, the blue crane, tortoises, steenbokkies, springbok, porcupines and the aardvark, to give just a few examples. It has been SKA policy to close water holes and drinking facilities on the two farms they have owned for years already, thus leaving no drinking facilities animals in the wild. Should SKA expand and continue this practise it would amount to mass destruction among these beautiful and rare species as they would simply dehydrate and die.</p>

         <h3>Damaged Ground</h3>

         <p>On site construction for the Kat7 and MeerKat projects have shown that an enormous amount of infrastructure is required for scientific purposes. Wide roads to transport satellite dishes, very high and large sheds, office blocks, on site housing facilities, and a large bunker-like construction to house a generating plant, several transformers, electronic equipment and computer rooms etc. It is hard to imagine that such ground may ever be re-rehabilitated or returned to its natural state. Each dish requires a large cleared terrain and access from all sides and dishes are linked by roads and power lines. One wonders what will happen once these structures are obsolete, outdated or should the project fail. Aerial pictures are available and clearly indicate damage to the natural environment on a large scale. Phase 1, 2 and 3 would multiply the ecological damage, not only in the Karoo but into Africa.</p>
        
	     <h3>White concave satellite dishes</h3>

	     <p>According to the SKA SA website 1 500 or 2000 dishes are planned within the core area alone. Could heat reflection from these large white dishes (each 15 m in diameter), placed in close proximity to each other, result in micro climate changes? All white surfaces reflect heat, even a white roof does and it can be measured. Will air currents, moisture content, and rainfall patterns be influenced in the immediate SKA areas? The reflections from the white dishes might attract insects by night, especially mosquitoes after rains during certain seasons. Could the planned core site become a breeding ground for insects and create problems?</p>

         <h2 id="social-impact">Social impact</h2>

	     <p>Congregations and sectors of the local community are joining to express their concerns and unite in solidarity. Self preservation, protecting future generations and preserving the environment is on peoples' minds and their agenda. SKA's expansion plans initially sent shock waves throughout the community, but a gradual shift towards an united front exercising damage control on a constructive level is falling into place. Ordinary citizens want their voices to be heard and want answers and solutions from the highest ranks and authorities.</p>

	     <p>Restrictions on radio frequencies and the loss of mobile communications will have direct consequences on all social structures. Much of the Northern Cape will be thrown back to an era before mobile technology, should the proposed legislation be passed. Human resources, potential growth, creativity and personal development could be compromised. Hand held mobile devices are educational tools and connects the global community. Families and friends will feel cut off from each other and this could typically lead to social problems. Many might choose to move away from the area, but perhaps this reduced human activity might be welcomed by the SKA foundation.</p>

	     <p>Municipalities are struggling nationally with chronic housing shortages, according to research work done by the International Labour Organisations (ILO)in 2015. Karoo towns are no exception, and the problem will worsen should people be displaced. For example, by late 2015 there were 630 applications for subsidised houses in the town of Carnarvon. Only about 80 homes have been built by the state in Carnarvon over the last 20 years (4 houses annually). Should farms no longer produce, more people will look for housing in the local towns, where crowded conditions, comparatively high rentals, and sanitary challenges already prevail.</p>
	 
	     <h3>Homeless people</h3>

	     <p>The number of registered homeless people in Carnarvon is 61, but according to a municipal employee, this figure is incomplete and could be much higher. There are several areas with shacks, people who sleep under the open sky, and overcrowded homes where large extended families are crammed into a small space. Social work is plentiful, and abusive substances pose a problem particularly with the youth and the lack of opportunities. The South African government is spending "astronomical" amounts on SKA while many of its people living in the area are in dire need of basic facilities and upliftment. Funds to the tune of R 600 000 recently disappeared out of the municipal coffers intended for a local soup kitchen to feed the poor. Social and political problems are escalating and resentment and conflict may grow.</p>

	     <h3>Local organisations</h3>

	     <p>Churches, recreational facilities, clubs and organisations and unions will lose members and their financial contributions. Cultural activities and annual traditions will fall away due to radio signal restrictions, such as the annual "fly-in" where pilots "jet" in to Carnarvon for a weekend of flying and fun. https://www.facebook.com/carnarvon.flyin   Many towns have quaint restaurants, small hotels, annual shows, sporting events, extra curricular activities and privately organised charities and social programs to add quality of life to rural existence. Typically the weaker members of society are taken care of by private initiatives and charitable organisations which run without state support. The success of all activities in rural towns, depend on financial contributions from the affluent sector and on the participation of all its people!</p>

	     <h2 id="heritage">Heritage and Cultural Impact</h2>

	     <p>There are dinosaur fossils in the Karoo as it was a swamp millions of years ago. Rock art, spearheads, remnants of early settlements and stone constructions are frequently found. These are often places of spiritual value to former inhabitants of the area and rightfully deserve to be honoured. Corbelled houses are unique to the area. There are very old and artistically crafted gravestones on farms where cemeteries house 5 or 6 generation. Some farms have beautiful old Victorian homes. Many towns have Victorian and Art Deco homes or structures and some of the early churches are true heritage gems. Simple stone masonry work of a by gone era with pleasing proportions adorn towns and farms. http://www.karoo-southafrica.co.za/?page_id=652  and  http://www.carnarvon.co.za/our_wonderful_heritage.htm</p>

         <p>Authors past and present of note come from this area or still reside here. And many famous stories and legends find their origin in this unique, hardy and somewhat rugged place. The extremities of the land and weather conditions are reflected in peoples faces, their moods and attitude. This is the stuff that makes them so different, so honest and real, and so like-able. There is sadness from the past and there is still hunger and need, and there is fear for the future is now unknown... But there is always time to talk, time for a handshake and time for a kind word, or argument. Life happens on the street, and people like to talk and laugh together. People have nicknames, very funny ones. Humour acts like cements and unites people at the core. Some famous characters form the Karoo can be found at  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Karoo</p>

         <p>Rhythm, joy, passionate belief and song flow from churches every Sunday morning. Souls uplift...joy and rhythm, rhythm and joy! Dance, in rhythm and joy with the people of the Northern Cape, and they will dance with you in joy. It is captivating, simply captivating. One example is the VG Kerk  https://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rynse_Sendinggenootskap</p>

         <p> And then there is the "riel" dance, a traditional dance performed in the dust...It is an age-old dance of the Khoisan performed to the beat of "boeremusiek", especially in the Karoo and Northern Cape. This will make your heart beat faster!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXdoYlqb-cM   and   http://www.san.org.za/history.php</p>      

         <h2 id="Public-Participation-Process">Public Participation Process</h2>

         <p>The Department of Science and Technology (DST) ran several workshops to engage with locals about SKA phase 1. Stakeholders were encouraged to object in writing rather than through debate at the meetings. Many written representations were forwarded to the DST but there are no known accounts of answers or solutions in return. Unfortunately these meetings were not well advertised and this limited participation. Also the minutes to these meetings (and also the meetings which SKA) were never shared with the public, and so continued discussion, negotiations and problem solving became impossible.</p>

          <p>The lack of minutes after meetings resulted in a disruption of the public participation process, and inadequate communication. The missing minutes, lack of certain impact studies, outstanding answers from the DST and the absence of the Expert reports have left the public in a vacuum. Late in 2016 SKA invited stakeholders along the intended corridor arms to information sessions. Some people were surprised to discover, at that late stage, that they were stakeholders.  By then the SEA was completed and these people were denied participation in the process.</p>

          <p>The public demanded to see the earliest impact studies and Expert reports before the AGA Act of 2007, and are still waiting for this document. Environmental Impact Assessments of 2007 and 2009 concerned with Kat7 and MeerKat respectively are available. The AGA Act, however, written in 2007 allows for SKA phase 1 and further phases. The SEA or EIA completed prior to the AGA Act is what the public requires to see.</p> 
	      <li>Save The Karoo asks for clarity about the Natural Environment Management Act (NEMA) and the impact SKA will have on the environment and peoples well-being. https://www.environment.co.za/environmental-laws-and-...</li>
          <li>Please comment on the International Ecocide Laws which came into effect in September 2016. Please explain why the South African Government canceled its ICC membership in October 2016. www.eradicatingecocide.com</li>
	      <li>Please explain why the publics formal written objections, have not been answered in months or years.</li>
	      <li>Why was an impact study not completed before cell phone signals were "modified" ("cut off" in layman's terms), and why was mobile connectivity not addressed directly, but only expressed in terms of radio frequency restrictions? Why are walkie talkies a suggested substitute when they have nothing to do with mobile connectivity, Internet and Aps?</li>

	
          <h2 id="maps and the AAA">Maps</h2>


          <p>The Astronomically Advantaged Area (AAA) as stipulated in the AGA Act of 2007, covers most of the Central Karoo area. This area will be governed by radio frequency restrictions once legislation is passed. All municipalities within the Northern Cape Province, excluding only one, the Sol Plaatje municipality will be affected. Radio frequencies below 100 Mhz, and above 25.5 Ghz will be tolerated within the AAA, effectively turning the Central Karoo into a silent reserve. Therefore the future of 950 000 people may be potentially affected directly or indirectly by such radio frequency restrictions. </p>

        <p>The size of the AAA inhttps://www.environment.gov.za/sites/default/files/images/ska_studyarea.jpg comparison to other well know areas:
131,957 km2 - Greece
116,096 km2 - Ohio (USA)

	     <h3>Locations!</h3>

	     <p>Radio astronomy websites explain that the absence of human activities is an important requirement for accurate data collection from the universe. Also high altitude and dryness are important. Water droplets, even the presence of fog in winter, may scatter radio signals and compromise data collection.</p>
	     <p>Environmental factors are also taken into consideration due to their potential impact on radio astronomy, for example altitude, weather, geology and topography.</p>
	     <p>Remote deserts might be considered cost prohibitive to develop for radio astronomy. The more remote the chosen locations is the higher the costs involved become. Therefore sites with existing infrastructure may be considered more cost effective, but typically infrastructure exists due to human settlement, especially due to financially viable communities. Of course is such cases conflicts easily result.</p>

	     <h3>ALMA, a good example</h3>

	     <p>The radio astronomy project ALMA, in Chile, is situated in a true desert, at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level where the rainfall is below 100 mm annually. The advantages of high altitude and dry climatic conditions for radio astronomy are highlighted on <a href="http://www.almaobservatory.org/">ALMA&#39;s</a> website. While the chosen site in South Africa is 1000 meters above sea level and has an average rainfall of 230 to 250 mmm annually.</p> 
	    
	     <h3>SKA Australia</h3>

	     <p>Australia's chosen site is situated in the Murchison Shire. According to <a href="http://www.ska.gov.au/">SKA Australia</a>, the site covers an area almost the size of the Netherlands, but only one hundred people live there. The population density of the Australian site is a mere fraction of the population density of the South Africa site. The population densities at the SKA site in Australia and the population density at the SKA site in South African site compare as follows:

Shire of Murchison, Western Australia

 - Population of 121  [2014] (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3218.0 Regional Population Growth, Australia)

 - Area of 45,030.2 km2 (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3218.0 Regional Population Growth, Australia)

 - Population Density of 0.0 persons/km2 [2014] (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3218.0 Regional Population Growth, Australia)

 - Known as the "Shire with no Town", as no gazetted townsite exists (Source: Shire of Murchison)

 - It is believed to be the only Shire in Australia where this exists (Source: Shire of Murchison)

 - It is the second least populated Local Government Area in Australia (Source: Murchison Shire Annual Report 2014-2015)

- Total number of businesses 3  [2013] (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics)


Northern Cape, South Africa

 - Population of 1,145,861 (Source: Statistics South Africa)

27 Municipalities of the Northern Cape, South Africa

 - Population Densities ranging from 0.3 - 78.9 persons/km2 [2011] (Source: Statistics South Africa)</p>

	    <p>The people of the Karoo are asking the SKA International Partners States and the SKA Non-Partner States to comment on the ecocide and possible human rights violations which they are directly or indirectly financing within the Karoo. We ask you explain your intentions in Africa at this present moment and also explain your intent towards future generations, the environment, the carbon footprint and climate change should air traffic be re-routed and the preservation of our land and our planet. Thank you very much.</p>
