            <p>The aim of this site is to share experiences and concerns
 of Karoo inhabitants due to the Square Kilometer Array project in South
 Africa. The beautiful Karoo and the life it sustains is under threat. 
If we do not act now it will be too late to protect this unique part of 
our planet. Construction of a "SKA phase 1" is already planned to 
commence in 2018, or perhaps even sooner.</p>

	    <p>
	    According to the <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-IEMP-2016-1.pdf">CSIR Integrated Management Plan</a>
 water requirements during peak construction of SKA phase 1 will be an 
astonishing 943 kilolitres per day. This is 10 to 20 times more than the
 average agricultural daily water requirement in the surrounding area, 
depending on the season, on comparable sized land. The Central Karoo is a
 semi-desert, and a fragile balance exists between the level of the 
water table and the sustainability of life, flora and fauna. The table

	    <h2>Some Background Information about SKA South Africa</h2>

	    <p>Many South Africans have been keen and excited about the radio 
astronomy, Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project. SKA marketing 
strategies and the <a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/">SKA website</a> 
present a convincing and impressive picture of SKA South Africa. There 
is no need to argue the scientific merits of the project.</p>
	    <p>The "other side" of the project is less convincing. It is the 
SocioEconomic impact and the Ecocide which will affect communities and 
the environment due to SKA phase 1, and the later phase 2. Construction 
of phase 1 is planned to start soon. Later SKA phases 2 is planned to 
reach far into the African Continent. According to the <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/79_Report_of_The_Expert_Panel_on_Radio_Quiet_Zone_and_RFI_Regulation.pdf">Radio Quiet Zone Document</a>,
 page 10, remote stations are proposed to be placed in Botswana, Ghana, 
Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. The RQZ 
document goes on to state that these African countries have "basic law",
 implying  that enforcing a RQZ or radio protected zones would be 
possible.</p>
	    <p>The current SKA site in the Karoo consists of two farms (Losberg
 and Meysdam) and covers 13,406 ha. Here pathfinder and precursor radio 
telescope dishes have been erected. The Kat-7 project, a test bed of 
seven dishes, was completed years ago. The MeerKAT project will 
eventually comprise of 64 dishes, a technology demonstrator for South 
Africa's bid to host the Square Kilometer Array, is under construction 
and will form part of SKA phase 1. MeerKat is still far form completion,
 and has suffered many delays. It has often been suggested that funding 
is the biggest challenge.</p>
<p> <img class="img-responsive" src="ska-main_files/kat7.jpg" alt="Kat7">
 </p><figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">The seven-dish MeerKAT precursor array, KAT-7</figcaption><p></p>

	
 
        <p> South Africa and Australia jointly won the bid in 2012 and 
are both official hosts, but South Africa will host the majority share. <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-Site-Advisory-Committee-16-Feb-2012.pdf">An International Site Advisory Committee decided which criteria determined the SKA host</a>.
 The South African SKA foundation is currently negotiating and buying 
more land (about 118 000 ha / or + - 36 farms) around the initial site, 
to create a larger core area of about 130 000 ha.</p>
        <p>SKA phase 1 does not only consist of the above mentioned core
 area, but also includes three long arm-like spiralling corridors. Along
 these corridors additional satellite dishes are to be constructed. 
These corridors are planned to run over "active farms". Servitudes on 
roads, power lines and pockets of land are planned. Construction along 
the spirals are expected to interupt farming activities over extended 
periods. Along these spirals restrictions will protect radio astronomy 
and affect farming activities for up to 11 km on either side of the 
spirals, totaling corridors of 22 km (or more in places) in width. These
 restrictions reduce or prohibit the generation of  power via certain 
generators, wind chargers and solar panels. Electric fencing, spark 
plugs (petrol driven vehicles included),flying an aeroplane, 
constructing roads and houses, broadcasting radio signals, operating 
microwaves, arc welding and the use of certain machines will be 
prohibited or restricted. Even appliances like TV`s, decoders, stoves, 
fridges, washing machines, electric geysers, alarm systems, remote 
controls, laptops, printers, digital cameras, lathes, trucks and 
bulldozers or graders will be restricted. Cell phones are banned 
outright in the regulated zones. A SKA official, Mr Adrian Tiplady, 
confirmed that signals have been "modified" in the past, and will 
continue to be "modified" to protect radio astronomy. The scientific 
term of "modification" in practical terms results in the loss of mobile 
communication systems. Only radio frequencies below 100 Mhz, and above 
25.5 Ghz will be tolerated. Therefore the use of mobile handhelds will 
become impossible.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="ska-main_files/sea-study-area.jpg" alt="SEA study area">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption text-right"> The total SEA area (SKA 
phase 1) comprises of 268 000 ha. Restrictions diminish farming activity
 beyond the wide corridors indicated in blue.</figcaption>
	</figure><p></p>
	
	
        <p>A person who contravenes the restrictions will face a fine of
 up to R 1 000 000 (one million rand) or imprisonment, or both according
 to a warning issued by Government Gazette. Within South Africa one 
million Rand would represent a challenging amount for an average person.
 Currently an ordinary loaf of bread in South Africa cost from under R10
 and may go up up to R15 depending on the type of bread, a litre of 
petrol sells for approximately R 13, while aviation fuel (Avgas) sells 
at just over R20 a litre.</p>
        
        <p>The above mentioned core area and corridors (SKA phase 1) are
 situated in a semi-desert called the Karoo. The Karoo makes up most of 
the Northern Cape Province and this province covers 30 % of South 
Africa's total land surface. Here sheep farming upholds the economy. 
Agricultural land is therefore under discussion and the stability of 3 
municipalities with 46 000 inhabitants is questioned. <a href="https://www.karoomeatoforigin.com/">Karoo, Meat of Origin</a>,
 a well-known organic lamb label with impressive export credentials, is 
proudly produced in the area. Arguably it is of the best meat in the 
world. SKA has already bought huge tracks of land in and around the 
intended core area, without waiting for the Council of Scientific and 
Industrial Research (CSIR) to first conclude an investigation and 
publish the its report. This report was  published on 31 January 2017., 
and it clearly warns that the SKA phase 1 will impact negatively on the 
affected area and that SKA's current plans will cause the communities to
 disintegrate. The <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-IEMP-2016-1.pdf">report (Integrated Environmental Management Plan for the South African mid-frequency array of SKA Phase 1)</a> suggests that alternatives must be looked at to prevent disintegration of the affected communities. <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/comments-and-inputs-form.pdf">Comments from the public may be submitted</a> by the 17 of March 2017. The <a href="mailto:skaphase1@csir.co.za">CSIR may be contacted and comments submitted via email at skaphase1@csir.co.za</a>, via post "PO Box 320, 7600, Stellenbosch, or via telephone nationally at 021 88 82429, or internationally +27 21 88 82429.</p>
        <p>In the document published in 2005, <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/26437_73_RITaskForce.pdf">"SKA Task Force on Regulatory Issues, November 2005"</a>,
  International experts recommend how to  implement the SKA project. On 
page 7 is stated "...a  radio-quiet  zone  (RQZ) is  necessary..." and 
on page 8, "Typical sectors that may be affected would be communications
 (both regulation  and communications infrastructure),land affairs, 
environmental  affairs, civil aviation  and  mineral  affairs. There  
may be further impact at the state or provincial level in terms of 
roads, distribution networks of electrical power and other public 
services." These experts do not mention human rights, ecocide or the 
social and economic impact. Recently a SKA official stated that the term
 "radio protected" would be more accurate than the term "radio silent". 
However, more information has been requested.</p>
	    <p>SKA phase 1 will be largely funded by the SKA International 
Partner States. An amount of Euro 650 million has been mentioned for the
 first phase. These financial contributors are  the United Kingdom, 
Canada, Sweden, Italy, The Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, India 
and China, according to the SKA official website. The SKA Organisation 
is a private company incorporated and has its <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/ska-organisation/">head office in the United Kingdom</a>
 (The SKA Organisation, SKAO, is responsible for coordinating the global
 activities of the SKA project. This includes engineering, science, site
 evaluation, operations and public outreach. While the latter point, 
public outreach, has not occured at all.) In addition there are several 
non-member States which benefit by receiving research data, such as 
Universities and the Max Planck Institution in Germany. The USA has part
 of its HERA project on the South African SKA core site. Further 
non-member states include France, Japan, Malta, Portugal, Spain and 
Switzerland. The "Save the Karoo" team has made concerted efforts to 
contact the Interantional member States but has not received reaction of
 note."</p>

	    <h2 id="impacts">Impacts, Aviation and Communication</h2>
        
        <h3>Aviation</h3>

        <p>Radio frequency restrictions and aviation laws are obviously 
contradictory concepts. Almost all flights to and from Cape Town have 
always flown over the Northern Cape as Cape Town is geographically at 
the southern tip of Africa. Therefore the Karoo was traditionally not a 
radio quiet or radio protected area. Obviously the availability of radio
 frequencies are paramount to aviation safety with regard to radar, 
navigation and radio communications. These rights were stipulated in the
 <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/Chicago-Protocol.pdf">Chicago Convention of 1944</a>
 and most nations are signatory to this agreement, including South 
Africa. Should flights to and from Cape Town be re-routed to protect 
astronomy within the Karoo? How much will this cost travellers? How 
would this affect the carbon footprint of air travel? SKA articles 
suggest that the Karoo is "beautifully radio quiet and ideal for radio 
astronomy". This is not so, with national and international flights 
routes going over the Central Karoo area and the Northern Cape. Besides 
most rural towns and even some farms have their own airstrips, 
indicating recreational aviation and emergencies services. <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/first-radio-licence-sa-issued-dr-j-van-rensburg-carnarvon">Carnarvon was historically not radio quiet or radio protected...</a></p><p> 

        </p><h3>Communication</h3>

        <p>The AGA Act no 21 of 2007, was drafted to allow for an 
Astronomically Advantaged Area (AAA) where legislation prohibits 
frequencies allowing cellphone signals. Admittedly cellphone 
communication vastly improved since 2007. By 2015 when SKA phase 1 was 
presented to the public, mobile technology had already changed the 
world. Smartphones are a way of life today. It is unthinkable to 
sacrifice the freedoms, safety, business opportunities and access to 
information afforded by mobile hand-held devices. Should cellphone 
signals be cut off due to legislation people affected by SKA phase 1 
will be left with weather-sensitive satellite land-line connections and 
wifi within their homes. Many members of society, especially finacially 
weaker ones, will be deprived of their only means of communication. A 
"souped-up" walkie-talkie with a vastly limited sms function and without
 internet connection has been offered to stakeholders by SKA, but nobody
 is excited about this option. Cellphones remain the chosen and only 
practical means of communication for most in the affected area.</p>

        <h2 id="council-for-scientific-and-industrial-research-(CSIR)">CSIR</h2>

	    <p>The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) commissioned several experts to perform a <a href="https://www.ska.ac.za/about/strategic-environmental-assessment/">Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)</a> within the area affected by SKA phase 1. <a href="http://www.skaphase1.csir.co.za/?page_id=984">Research was collected on economic, social, environmental and heritage and cultural issues</a>. This study ran throughout most of 2016 and the <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-IEMP-2016-1.pdf">report</a> was published on January 30th 2017.</p>

     <p>Stakeholders, interested and affected parties may <a href="http://www.skaphase1.csir.co.za/?page_id=175">register on the CSIR website</a> and also <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/comments-and-inputs-form.pdf">comment, object or question</a> the <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-IEMP-2016-1.pdf">CSIR's Integrated Environmental Management Plan</a>.
     </p>

        <p>The CSIR website stated in November 2016 that its board 
members were appointed by the Minister of the Department of Science and 
Technology from 2015 through 2018. These dates co-inside with the 
initial announcement of the land acquisition for SKA phase 1 and the 
intended start of construction for SKA phase 1. This has raised 
questions about a possible conflict of interests. Despite this concern 
the report and specialist studies clearly warn that the impact of the 
current SKA plan  will disintegrate communities, hurt the local and 
national economies and at worse result in a destructive downward spiral 
for SKA and the local population due to public resistance.</p>


	     <h2 id="economic-impact">Economic Impact</h2>

	   	 <p>The <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/Agriculture-Economic-Study.pdf">CSIR's Agricultural Economic Study</a>
 has presented a very conservative view and calculated according to lamb
 prices in early 2016. The price paid for lamb has increased 
considerably since early 2016. About 15 000 to 16 000 lambs and 7000 
adult sheep are annually marketed on the farms SKA intends for its core 
area of phase 1. Save The Karoo puts the annual loss at 20 to 30 million
 and this certainly will impact hard on the local communities. (The 
figure in the report is somewhat lower but this could be due to price 
fluctuations on the meat market over the last year). Abattoirs will be 
affected and the profitability of these companies will not be 
sustainable, as they would drop about 10% in slaughter volumes. One may 
consider that a minimum monthly wage of about R 3 500, is being debated 
in South Africa. This puts the loss of 20 to 30 million into 
perspective. Lamb and mutton is not the only source of income in this 
area. Stud farming, wool and feed-lots also generate capital.</p>

	</figure>
	<p></p>
         <p> Farm workers will not find new employment easily as 
unemployment figures are around 32 % in the area. Alternative job 
opportunities are not being created. There are no government incentive 
programs to attract new business opportunities to the area. In local 
towns many live on social Government grants. News reports within South 
Africa are predicting that funds for social grants are being depleted.</p> 

	     <p>Abattoirs, fuel suppliers, agricultural co-operatives, hardware
 stores, supermarkets, banks, tradesmen, construction and engineering 
services will all lose customers. Suppliers of veterinarian products, 
solar power and pumps, irrigation and water systems, fencing and general
 farm equipment will drop sales. Remote monitoring equipment used to 
track stock, read water levels, ensure safety of people and animals and 
prevent stock theft will suffer a decline in sales. Meat agents, 
marketing-, transport- and packing companies, retailers, the hospitality
 industry and finally ordinary consumers will be affected nationally. 
The highly respected and famous brand, "Karoo, Meat of Origin", with 
export credentials will be dealt a great setback.</p>

	<p></p>

         <h3>National Economy</h3>
	     
	     
	     <p>Reduced turnovers affect sales nationally in commodities, 
insurances, recreation, travel and assets investment. Fewer transactions
 result in a decline of sales tax each time money changes hands, and 
reduced income taxes. These "add-ons" show that a loss of 18 million 
rand in farming activity will translate to a decline in the South 
African GDP equivalent to R 263 million. It is highly unlikely that any 
scientific project could replace such amounts to the affected area or to
 the growing economy of South Africa. It is not fair to refer to the 
Karoo as a low-income, uninhabited and impoverished area, as sadly there
 are many poorer areas within South Africa despite higher population 
densities. The argument based on poverty in the Karoo has been used to 
justify taking agricultural land and using it for scientific purposes. 
Sadly this decision will cause much greater poverty in the Karoo. <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/Agriculture-Economic-Study.pdf">The economic report</a> also makes it clear that the SKA project cannot compensate for these financial losses.</p>

         <p>Towns and businesses might decline and shrink. Displacement 
of people may result. More and more employees may land on the street if a
 downward trend is started. Typically, financially weaker members of 
society might be disadvantaged the most. Local families who lost 
ownership of property under the previous regime have not recovered 
losses or enjoyed compensation to date. Now these communities face more 
disadvantages. The town called Van Wyksvlei suffered a blow when a 
weaponry testing site called Alkantpan bought out farms (85 000 ha) in 
the district in 1987. The town was greatly reduced and impoverished. 
This is an explicit example of what Karoo communities are exposed to 
once farms are forced out of production. The inhabitants in the Karoo 
are completely reliant on agriculture for their well being and survival.
 Alkantpan and SKA ground are very close together and this area cannot 
take another punch to its economy. Alkantpan brought Van Wyksvlei to its
 knees, how much more should these communities be deprived of?<a href="http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45559:sixty-percent-plus-of-alkantpans-inco">At Alkantpan, foreign clients benefit  while locals suffer</a>.</p> 

         <p>
         	   	 </p><figure class="figure">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="ska-main_files/sheep.jpg" alt="merino sheep">
	
	</figure>
	<p></p>
         <p>Laws within South Africa demand Capital gains taxes on 
property. Therefore once landowners are forced to sell ground they 
cannot replace land of a similar quality. These losses are not taken 
into account or compensated for by the land buy-out scheme benefiting 
the SKA project. Individuals suffer real losses.</p>

	     <p>Estimates as to how farming activities along the intended 
spiralling corridors will be economically affected due to the 
regulations and restrictions are tricky to calculate. Land management 
and land  preservation without the use of machines and equipment might 
be impossible in the long run, and cause environmental damage. The 
inconveniences caused by the regulations and the absence of 
technological development associated with radio frequencies could in 
time deter younger generations from farming in the area. The remote 
monitoring equipment allowing modern and convenient farming practices 
might be  prohibited, and pose safety threats. This will cause a 
substantial loss in income for these farms and all the dependants. Farms
 could be reduced to stock posts in due course. Stock posts are 
typically less productive, contribute to falling populations figures and
 reduced incomes. The migration patterns from rural to urban areas 
stress many big cities in South Africa already. Where unemployment, lack
 of accommodation, poor living conditions, increased crime, transport, 
health, sanitation and hygiene are mayor expenses to the national 
economy. Functioning agricultural and rural communities alleviate 
problems in cities and improve the population distribution of a nation. 
Agricultural communities feed those who live in cities, and it seems 
politicians and scientist forget the roll agriculture plays within a 
nations well-being and stability.</p>

	     <h3>Food security</h3>

	     <p>Economics, productivity, human resources and food security 
cannot be separated. Food security has been an issue in Southern Africa,
 especially after recent droughts. Currently 25 percent of South 
Africa's sheep are found in the Northern Cape, according to National 
livestock Statistics. Therefore this area contributes substantially to 
the national food basket and national revenue, despite that it is a 
semi-desert and has a relatively low population.</p>

	     <h3>Wool, Game and Tourism</h3>

	     <p>The Northern Cape is the fourth largest wool supplier in the 
country, and the industry is growing due to better wool prices and a 
weak Rand. Northern Cape wool producers do well nationally, and can 
boast a number of well-respected breeders. The game industry is growing 
steadily, with surprisingly high prices making news at annual animal 
auctions. The game and tourist industries are closely linked. The Karoo 
is a sought after by nature lovers seeking tranquillity, unspoiled open 
space and simply "getting away from it all". But, much more can be done 
to promote the Karoo as a "Great Escape" tourist destination. There are 
some very beautiful farms with corbelled houses, rock art, scenic walks 
and with great hospitality. People are know to be kind and helpful. Good
 accommodation and fine eateries with exceptional lamb on the menu makes
 it a fine place to visit and experience something completely different.</p>

	     <h3>SKA makes some contributions to a local town</h3>

	     <p>SKA has donated computers for educational purpose in Carnarvon.
 Some students received bursaries for further studies, and SKA employ a 
member of staff at the Carnarvon school. Some locals are employed to 
develop SKA infrastructure during construction, but this ends once 
construction is completed. SKA officials have proposed employing farm 
workers, who stand to lose their jobs, eradicating invasive trees in the
 area. However, farm workers are a very specialised workforce and might 
not want to chop down trees for a living. SKA may inform Save The Karoo 
about the benefits Williston, Van Wyksvlei and Brandvlei have received 
so these benefits may be included on this site. Certain handouts might 
instil a situation where dependency and expectations grow, whereas 
others may encourage own initiative. Donations which directly stimulate 
financial growth and alternative work opportunities in the area would be
 most effective.</p>

         <p>The <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/Documents/SKA-IEMP-2016-1.pdf">CSIR report</a>
 mentions 9 points of advantages which SKA will bring to Carnarvon. 
These benefits seem to be aimed at uplifting Carnarvon's community 
rather than providing sustainable economic growth over the next 
half-a-century or more. The way forward is therefore unclear, 
considering that constructions may take several decades and that a fully
 operational SKA is expected to run for around 50 years. Phase 1 will 
soon displace people, but some of the promised facilities mentioned in 
the CSIR document are not in place. These  benefits will just touch a 
few lives in comparison to the scale of phase 1. It is questioned 
whether much of the work force for future construction will be imported 
from far away, housed on site and treated in a on-site clinic, 
disadvantaging the local workforce further.</p>

	     <h3>The Karoo</h3>

	     <p>The Karoo has a unique landscape and a sensitive ecosystem. Dry
 phases are common in the Karoo, but the area is quite drought 
resistant, meaning that the vegetation has relatively good nutritional 
value even during drought periods. The central Karoo has average annual 
rainfall of about 230 to 250 mm. After the rains it turns green very 
rapidly, providing excellent grazing and substantial ground cover. Hardy
 indigenous plants and animal species of enormous diversity have 
developed over millions of years and adapted to heat, cold, droughts and
 floods. Typically, erosion can occur after the thunderstorms, and it is
 important to retain top soil and not disturb the natural vegetation or 
surface areas. Large scale construction activities will remove and 
damage  vegetation and top soil, potentially creating opportunities for 
soil erosion which may in time spread over vast areas. Rehabilitation of
 hardy vegetation requires diligent effort over an extended period of 
time, often several decades, as it is a semi-desert. The <a href="http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-the-magical-great-karoo">Karoo is not a desert.</a>   </p>
	     
	     
	
	     

         <h3>Wild Animals need drinking facilities</h3> 

	     <p>Wild animals in the Karoo have adapted to farming conditions 
and live in synchronized relationship with farming stock. It is no 
longer possible for wild animals to migrate according to water 
availability as they did in former times before fences were introduced 
to the area. The wild animals use the drinking facilities available on 
farms. Many animal species are protected and endangered in the Karoo. 
Particular attention must be given to the riverine rabbit, birds of 
prey, in particular the Verreaux eagle, the blue crane, tortoises, 
steenbokkies, springbok, porcupines and the aardvark, to give just a few
 examples. It has been SKA policy to close water holes and drinking 
facilities on the two farms they have owned for years already, thus 
leaving no drinking facilities for animals in the wild. Should SKA 
expand and continue this practice it would amount to further mass 
destruction among these beautiful and rare species as they would simply 
dehydrate and die. The CSIR environmental report suggests that the  
animals in the wild will become accustomed to living with less and 
eventually no water....One has to wonders whose interests such experts 
are protecting.</p>

         <h3>Damaged Ground</h3>

         <p>On site construction for the Kat7 and MeerKat projects have 
shown that an enormous amount of infrastructure is required. On the core
 site are wide roads to transport satellite dishes, very large sheds, 
office blocks, on site housing facilities, and a large bunker-like 
construction to house a generating plant, several transformers, 
electronic equipment and computer facilities. along the spiralling 
corridors Wide roads will cut through active farms to allow for 
satellite dishes, each dish with a power station, all connected to each 
other and a central control and computer facility. It is hard to imagine
 that such ground may ever be re-rehabilitated or returned to its 
natural state. Each dish requires a large cleared terrain and access 
from all sides and dishes are linked by roads and power lines. One 
wonders what will happen once these structures are obsolete, outdated or
 should the project fail. Aerial pictures are available and clearly 
indicate damage to the natural environment on a large scale. Phase 2 
would multiply the ecological damage as the density of dishes will be 
vastly increased, not only in the Karoo but also into Africa. Several 
thousand dishes have been mentioned to be constructed in the final plan.</p>

	     <h3>White concave satellite dishes</h3>

	     <p>According to the SKA SA website 1 500 or 2000 dishes are 
planned within the core area alone. Could heat reflection from these 
large white dishes (each 15 m in diameter), placed in close proximity to
 each other, result in micro climate changes? All white surfaces reflect
 heat, even a white roof does and it can be measured. Will air currents,
 moisture content, and rainfall patterns be influenced in the immediate 
SKA areas? The reflections from the white dishes might attract insects 
by night, especially mosquitoes after rains during certain seasons. 
Could the planned core site become a breeding ground for insects and 
create problems?</p>
	     
	     

         <h2 id="social-impact">Social impact</h2>
         
         
	     

	     <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kreebergfees">Congregations and sectors of the local community</a>
 are joining to express their concerns and unite in solidarity. Self 
preservation, protecting future generations and preserving the 
environment is on peoples' minds. SKA's expansion plans initially sent 
shock waves throughout the community, but a gradual shift towards an 
united front exercising damage control on a constructive level is 
falling into place. Ordinary citizens want their voices to be heard and 
want answers and solutions.</p>

	     <p>Restrictions on radio frequencies and the loss of mobile 
communications will have direct consequences on all social structures. 
Much of the Northern Cape will be thrown back to an era before mobile 
technology. Human resources, potential growth, creativity and personal 
development could be compromised. Hand held mobile devices are 
educational tools and connects the global community. Families and 
friends will feel cut off from each other and this could typically lead 
to social problems. Many might choose to move away from the area, and 
perhaps reduced human activity might be welcomed by the SKA foundation.</p>

	     <p>Municipalities are struggling nationally with chronic housing 
shortages, according to research work done by the International Labour 
Organisations (ILO)in 2015. Karoo towns are no exception, and the 
problem will worsen should people be displaced. For example, by late 
2015 there were 630 applications for subsidized houses in the town of 
Carnarvon. Only about 80 homes have been built by the state in Carnarvon
 over the last 20 years (4 houses annually). Should farms no longer 
produce, more people will look for housing in the local towns, where 
crowded conditions, comparatively high rentals, and sanitary challenges 
already prevail. The CSIR report neglects to mention the housing 
shortage in Carnarvon, but mentions the housing shortages in towns 
further away from the core area.</p>
	 
	     <h3>Homeless people</h3>

	     <p>The number of registered homeless people in Carnarvon was 61 
early in 2016. According to a municipal employee, this figure is 
incomplete and could be much higher. There are several areas with 
shacks, people who sleep under the open sky, and overcrowded homes where
 large extended families are crammed into a small space. Social work is 
plentiful, and abusive substances pose a problem. The South African 
government is spending "astronomical" amounts on SKA while many of its 
people living in the area are in dire need of basic facilities. Funds to
 the tune of R 600 000 recently disappeared out of the municipal coffers
 intended for a local soup kitchen to feed the poor. Social and 
political problems may escalate should unemployment figures rise.</p>

	     <h3>Local organisations</h3>

	     <p>Churches, recreational facilities, clubs and organisations and 
unions will lose members and their financial contributions. Cultural 
activities and annual traditions will fall away due to radio signal 
restrictions, such as the annual <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carnarvon.flyin">fly-in</a>
 where pilots "jet" in to Carnarvon for a weekend of flying and fun. 
Many towns have quaint restaurants, small hotels, annual shows, sporting
 events, extra curricular activities and privately organised charities 
and social programs to add quality of life to rural existence. Typically
 the weaker members of society are taken care of by private initiatives 
and charitable organisations as some operate with little or no state 
support. The success of all activities in rural towns, depend on 
financial contributions from the farming sector and on the participation
 of all its people.</p>

	     <h2 id="heritage">Heritage and Cultural Impact</h2>
	     
	     
	   
	     <p>There are dinosaur fossils in the Karoo as it was a swamp 
millions of years ago. Rock art, spearheads, remnants of early 
settlements and stone constructions are frequently found. These are 
often places of spiritual value to former inhabitants of the area and 
rightfully deserve to be honoured. Corbelled houses are unique to the 
area. There are very old and artistically crafted gravestones on farms 
where cemeteries house 5 or 6 generation. Some farms have beautiful old 
Victorian homes. Many towns have Victorian and Art Deco homes or 
structures and some of the early churches are true heritage gems. Simple
 stone masonry work of a by gone era with pleasing proportions adorn 
towns and farms. There are <a href="http://savethekaroo.com/40-heritage-sites-in-carnarvon.php">40 heritage sites listed in Carnarvon</a>.

         <p>Authors past and present of note come from this area or 
still reside here. And many famous stories and legends find their origin
 in this unique, hardy and somewhat rugged place. The extremities of the
 land and weather conditions are reflected in peoples faces, their moods
 and attitude. This is the stuff that makes them so different, so honest
 and real, and so like-able. There is sadness from the past and there is
 still hunger and need, and there is fear for the future is now 
unknown... But there is always time to talk, time for a handshake and 
time for a kind word, or argument. Life happens on the street, and 
people like to talk and laugh together. People have nicknames, very 
funny ones. Humour acts like cements and unites people at the core. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Karoo">Here are some famous characters form the Karoo</a></p>

         <h2 id="Public-Participation-Process">Public Participation Process</h2>

         <p>The Department of Science and Technology (DST) invited
smaller groups of stakeholders (isolated from the larger community) to
so-called interactive "workshops". However these meetings amounted to
mere information sessions and stakeholders were invited to raise 
objections in writing to the Minister, rather than through debate at
these meetings. Many written representations from stakeholders were 
forwarded to the DST but there are no known accounts of answers or 
solutions in return. Unfortunately these meetings were not well 
advertised and this limited participation. Many members of the 
community remain uninformed about the plans or impacts of SKA on 
the Northern Cape, to this day. The minutes to these meetings were 
never shared with the public, and so continued discussion, 
negotiations and problem solving became impossible. The public is 
ill-informed despite information meetings where transparency was 
lacking and solutions have not been discussed.</p>
         
         <p>SKA representatives have also regularly held meetings with 
local inhabitants, but no minutes were supplied either. It became common
 practise at the opening of meetings hosted by SKA for a representative 
to firstly admit that the organisation had not behaved in a transparent 
manner in the past, but that it would change with immediate effect. The 
public would then be requested to be trusting of SKA's and its good 
will. Such comments have been repeated at almost every public meeting. 
However the minutes of these meetings were not supplied but rather 
continued to be withheld despite several requests. Some SKA officials 
have persistently claimed at public meetings that a phase 2 is a mere 
dream and will never happen. This is clearly to calm people down as the 
project threatens to swallow more and more space, while displacing more 
and more people. There is a lot of literature on the later phase and 
even agreements with other African countries. On the 17 of February 2017
 a SKA representative admitted that phase 2 is planned and a reality.</p>

         <p>The lack of minutes after meetings resulted in a disruption 
of the public participation process, and inadequate communication. The 
missing minutes, lack of certain impact studies, outstanding answers 
from the DST and SKA have left the public in a vacuum. Late in 2016 SKA 
invited stakeholders along the intended corridor arms to information 
sessions. Some people were surprised to discover, at that late stage, 
that they were stakeholders.  By then the SEA was completed and these 
people were denied participation in the public participation process 
completely.</p>

         <p>The public demanded to see the earliest impact studies, 
public participation and Expert reports before the AGA Act of 2007. 
Which laws allow for such an Act without the public having access to all
 the information in advance?  Environmental Impact Assessments of <a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/skasa_final_eia_report_2007.pdf">2007</a> and <a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/skasa_eia_report_2009.pdf">2009</a>
 concerned with Kat7 and MeerKat respectively are available. The AGA 
Act, however, written in 2007 allows for SKA phase 1, and a further 
phase.</p> 
	     <li>Save The Karoo asks for clarity about the <a href="http://www.kruger2canyons.org/029%20-%20NEMA.pdf">Natural Environment Management Act (NEMA)</a> and the impact SKA will have on the environment and peoples well-being. </li>
         <li>Please comment on the <a href="http://eradicatingecocide.com/the-law/">International Law</a>
 . The ICC extended its remit in September 2016 to include ecocide in 
the existing Human Rights law. This is preparing a way forward for 
Ecocide Laws to stand independently and for our planet and its citizens 
to enjoy a higher level of protection. Why did the South African 
Government cancel its ICC membership in October 2016. How could this 
happen without a public participation process?</li>
	     <li>Why have the public's formal written objections, not been answered in months or even years.</li>
	     <li>Why was an impact study not completed before cell phone 
signals were "modified" ("cut off" in layman's terms), and why was 
mobile connectivity not addressed directly, but only expressed in terms 
of radio frequency restrictions? Why are walkie talkies a suggested 
substitute when they have nothing to do with mobile connectivity, 
Internet and Aps? Since 2007 SKA has repeatedly stated that it would 
uplift the affected area and improve conditions. Good things were 
promised especially in 2007, and now stakeholders are facing the 
possibility of their communities disintegrating according to the SEA 
report.</li>


	      
	
         <h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>


         <p>The Central Karoo Astronomically Advantaged Area (CKAAA) was
 first stipulated in the AGA Act of 2007. Later, on the 19 February 
2010, the minister of Science and Technology declared the whole of the 
Northern Cape (green province on the map) an AAA, excluding only Sol 
Plaaatje municipality with Kimberley as the capital. Therefore all 
Northern Cape  municipalities excluding one could in future be affected 
and regulated. Only radio frequencies below 100 Mhz, and above 25.5 Ghz 
will not be subject to restriction. This potentially turns the province 
into a silent reserve or  into a radio protected area. Will the air 
space above this province become a no-fly zone? Will mobile 
communication be lost? South African statistics show that the population
 of the Northern Cape is 1 150 900, and that the population of the Sol 
Plaatjie municipality is 250 000.</p>
          
         <p>Will the future of about 950 000 people be potentially impacted in the Northern Cape by further SKA expansion.</p>
          
         <h3>The Central Karoo AAA falls in the heart-land of organic meat and wool production.</h3> 
         <p>Here a more affluent agriculturally based economy exists than in many other parts of the Northern Cape.</p>

	     <h3>"The Bigger Picture"</h3>

	     <p>On the 23 rd November 2015, the Department of Science and Technology published <a href="http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/39442_gon1166s.pdf">Government Gazette number 1166</a>.
 Eight corridors are indicated within the AAA. The following quote 
accompanies this map; " The map below depicts the protection corridors 
required for approximately 54 SKA  radio  astronomy  stations  located  
within  the  Karoo  Central  Astronomy  Advantage  Area  1".  Save The 
Karoo would like to apologize for the poor quality of the corridor maps,
 but these are the best maps received from the Department of Science and
 Technology to date.</p>

	     <h3>Locations!</h3>

	     <p>Radio astronomy websites explain that the absence of human 
activities is an important requirement for accurate data collection from
 the universe. Also high altitude and dryness are important. Water 
droplets, even the presence of fog in winter, may scatter radio signals 
and compromise data collection.</p>
	     <p>Environmental factors are also taken into consideration due to 
their potential impact on radio astronomy, for example altitude, 
weather, geology and topography.</p>
	     <p>Remote deserts might be considered cost prohibitive to develop 
for radio astronomy. The more remote the chosen locations is the higher 
the costs involved become. Therefore sites with existing infrastructure 
may be considered more cost effective, but typically infrastructure 
exists due to human settlement, especially due to financially viable 
communities... and conflict may result.</p>

	     <h3>ALMA, a good example</h3>

	     <p>The radio astronomy project ALMA, in Chile, is situated in a 
true desert, at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level where the 
rainfall is below 100 mm annually. The advantages of high altitude and 
dry climatic conditions for radio astronomy are highlighted on <a href="http://www.almaobservatory.org/">ALMA's</a>
 website. While the chosen site in South Africa is 1000 meters above sea
 level and has an average rainfall of 230 to 250 mm annually.</p> 
	    
	     <h3>SKA Australia</h3>

	     <p>Australia's chosen site is situated in the Murchison Shire. According to <a href="http://www.ska.gov.au/">SKA Australia</a>,
 the site covers an area almost the size of the Netherlands, but only 
one hundred people live there. The population density of the Australian 
site is a mere fraction of the population density of the South Africa 
site. The population densities at the SKA site in Australia and the 
population density at the SKA site in South African site compare as 
follows:</p>

	    <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

	    <p>The people of the Karoo are asking the SKA International 
Partners States and the SKA Non-Partner States to take a close look at 
the SKA SA project which they are financing. Please consider the 
inhabitants of the Northern Cape and Africa now and in the future. The 
people of the Karoo and future generations, including the unborn, need 
to be protected. The natural environment on which we depend must be 
protected from exploitation, destruction and from ecocide.</p>
