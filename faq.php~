                                No, currently SKA owns 13 406 ha and only have precursors and pathfinders constructed on a small area of this ground. Most of this land lies vacant. SKA  still want to buy much more land in order to expand. The big part of the SKA project,  SKA phase 1 has not yet been constructed. It  is only planned for 2018 and it will take many years to complete. Now is the right time to question the chosen site for SKA's further  development.

                                <p>An SKA expert explained the regulations and resulting restrictions placed on the Astronomically Advantaged Area ( AAA) within which SKA lies as follows: "You may not enter or reside in this region without permission from the management authority. You may not do most things compatible with civilised life - such as erect lights, fly an airplane, drive a truck, construct a road, build a house, or broadcast a radio signal - in this region without permission. Even such farm-like activities as combine harvesting and arc-welding will be severely restricted or prohibited."</p><p>Later the same expert added more restrictions on generating power (even wind energy), spark plugs (petrol driven vehicles included), electric fencing,  digital mobile equipment like hand held devices and other electric equipment. The are also restrictions on traffic and access to some roads is controlled.</p>

                                The modification to radio signals affecting cell phone reception will upset  most people. Mobile connectivity will be lost. Up to the minute news, information, and communication will leave the public feeling cut off from the rest of the world.  Many businesses will suffer. Many people will loose their only chance of Internet access.

                                This question is difficult to answer with certainty. SKA calls the Karoo a "remote desert" and "radio quiet", but South Africans know that the Karoo is a semi-desert, with great agricultural value. If the Karoo were sufficiently radio quiet, why is mobile connectivity currently being lost? One SKA official did indicate that a true desert would be too cost prohibitive for such a project. Obviously, existing infrastructures in the respective municipal areas have made it cheaper for SKA to construct the pathfinders and precursor satellite dishes in the area.
